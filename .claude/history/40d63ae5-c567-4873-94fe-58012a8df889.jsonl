Create timestamp-based folder: requirements/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-[slug]\r\n2. Extract slug from $ARGUMENTS (e.g., \"add user profile\" → \"user-profile\")\r\n3. Create initial files:\r\n   - 00-initial-request.md with the user's request\r\n   - metadata.json with status tracking\r\n4. Read and update requirements/.current-requirement with folder name\r\n5. Use mcp__RepoPrompt__get_file_tree (if available) to understand overall structure:\r\n   - Get high-level architecture overview\r\n   - Identify main components and services\r\n   - Understand technology stack\r\n   - Note patterns and conventions\r\n\r\n### Phase 2: Context Discovery Questions\r\n6. Generate the five most important yes/no questions to understand the problem space:\r\n   - Questions informed by codebase structure\r\n   - Questions about user interactions and workflows\r\n   - Questions about similar features users currently use\r\n   - Questions about data/content being worked with\r\n   - Questions about external integrations or third-party services\r\n   - Questions about performance or scale expectations\r\n   - Write all questions to 01-discovery-questions.md with smart defaults\r\n   - Begin asking questions one at a time proposing the question with a smart default option\r\n   - Only after all questions are asked, record answers in 02-discovery-answers.md as received and update metadata.json. Not before.\r\n\r\n### Phase 3: Targeted Context Gathering (Autonomous)\r\n7. After all discovery questions answered:\r\n   - Use mcp__RepoPrompt__search (if available) to find specific files based on discovery answers\r\n   - Use mcp__RepoPrompt__set_selection and read_selected_files (if available) to batch read relevant code\r\n   - Deep dive into similar features and patterns\r\n   - Analyze specific implementation details\r\n   - Use WebSearch and or context7 for best practices or library documentation\r\n   - Document findings in 03-context-findings.md including:\r\n     - Specific files that need modification\r\n     - Exact patterns to follow\r\n     - Similar features analyzed in detail\r\n     - Technical constraints and considerations\r\n     - Integration points identified\r\n\r\n### Phase 4: Expert Requirements Questions\r\n8. Now ask questions like a senior developer who knows the codebase:\r\n   - Write the top 5 most pressing unanswered detailed yes/no questions to 04-detail-questions.md\r\n   - Questions should be as if you were speaking to the product manager who knows nothing of the code\r\n   - These questions are meant to to clarify expected system behavior now that you have a deep understanding of the code\r\n   - Include smart defaults based on codebase patterns\r\n   - Ask questions one at a time\r\n   - Only after all questions are asked, record answers in 05-detail-answers.md as received\r\n\r\n### Phase 5: Requirements Documentation\r\n9. Generate comprehensive requirements spec in 06-requirements-spec.md:\r\n   - Problem statement and solution overview\r\n   - Functional requirements based on all answers\r\n   - Technical requirements with specific file paths\r\n   - Implementation hints and patterns to follow\r\n   - Acceptance criteria\r\n   - Assumptions for any unanswered questions\r\n\r\n## Question Formats:\r\n\r\n### Discovery Questions (Phase 2):\r\n```\r\n## Q1: Will users interact with this feature through a visual interface?\r\n**Default if unknown:** Yes (most features have some UI component)\r\n\r\n## Q2: Does this feature need to work on mobile devices?\r\n**Default if unknown:** Yes (mobile-first is standard practice)\r\n\r\n## Q3: Will this feature handle sensitive or private user data?\r\n**Default if unknown:** Yes (better to be secure by default)\r\n\r\n## Q4: Do users currently have a workaround for this problem?\r\n**Default if unknown:** No (assuming this solves a new need)\r\n\r\n## Q5: Will this feature need to work offline?\r\n**Default if unknown:** No (most features require connectivity)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expert Questions (Phase 4):\r\n```\r\n## Q7: Should we extend the existing UserService at services/UserService.ts?\r\n**Default if unknown:** Yes (maintains architectural consistency)\r\n\r\n## Q8: Will this require new database migrations in db/migrations/?\r\n**Default if unknown:** No (based on similar features not requiring schema changes)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Important Rules:\r\n- ONLY yes/no questions with smart defaults\r\n- ONE question at a time\r\n- Write ALL questions to file BEFORE asking any\r\n- Stay focused on requirements (no implementation)\r\n- Use actual file paths and component names in detail phase\r\n- Document WHY each default makes sense\r\n- Use tools available if recommended ones aren't installed or available\r\n\r\n## Metadata Structure:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"id\": \"feature-slug\",\r\n  \"started\": \"ISO-8601-timestamp\",\r\n  \"lastUpdated\": \"ISO-8601-timestamp\",\r\n  \"status\": \"active\",\r\n  \"phase\": \"discovery|context|detail|complete\",\r\n  \"progress\": {\r\n    \"discovery\": { \"answered\": 0, \"total\": 5 },\r\n    \"detail\": { \"answered\": 0, \"total\": 0 }\r\n  },\r\n  \"contextFiles\": [\"paths/of/files/analyzed\"],\r\n  \"relatedFeatures\": [\"similar features found\"]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Phase Transitions:\r\n- After each phase, announce: \"Phase complete. Starting [next phase]...\"\r\n- Save all work before moving to next phase\r\n- User can check progress anytime with /requirements-status\r\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"5916f71e-5ae8-4551-8b45-f34c3bd7ed7e","timestamp":"2025-08-31T12:06:07.965Z"}
