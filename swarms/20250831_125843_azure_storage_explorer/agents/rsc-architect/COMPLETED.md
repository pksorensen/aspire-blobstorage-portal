# RSC Architecture Engineer - COMPLETED

## Summary

Successfully designed and implemented a comprehensive 100% React Server Components (RSC) + Server Actions architecture for the Azure Storage Explorer web application with zero API routes.

## Deliverables Completed

### 1. Architecture Design Document
- **File**: `/workspaces/aspire-blobstorage/swarms/20250831_125843_azure_storage_explorer/agents/rsc-architect/RSC_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Content**: Complete architectural overview with RSC patterns, data flow, security model, and integration patterns
- **Key Features**: Server-first approach, streaming with Suspense, Next.js caching integration

### 2. Azure Storage SDK Wrapper
- **File**: `/workspaces/aspire-blobstorage/src/blob-storage-management/lib/azure-storage.ts`
- **Content**: Production-ready Azure Blob Storage integration for RSCs
- **Features**:
  - Singleton BlobServiceClient with connection string security
  - Cached operations using `unstable_cache` with appropriate TTLs
  - Complete CRUD operations for containers and blobs
  - Comprehensive error handling with custom `AzureStorageError` class
  - TypeScript interfaces matching test types
  - Storage metrics and existence checks

### 3. Server Actions Library
- **File**: `/workspaces/aspire-blobstorage/src/blob-storage-management/lib/azure-actions.ts`
- **Content**: Complete Server Actions for all Azure Storage mutations
- **Features**:
  - Container operations (create, delete, update metadata)
  - Blob operations (upload files/text, delete, copy, update metadata/tags, set tier)
  - Batch operations (bulk delete)
  - Automatic cache invalidation with `revalidatePath()` and `revalidateTag()`
  - Form data handling and validation
  - Structured error responses

### 4. Component Specifications
- **File**: `/workspaces/aspire-blobstorage/swarms/20250831_125843_azure_storage_explorer/agents/rsc-architect/COMPONENT_SPECIFICATIONS.md`
- **Content**: Detailed RSC vs Client Component boundaries and specifications
- **Features**:
  - Clear separation of concerns between server and client components
  - Integration patterns with code examples
  - Props interfaces and data flow patterns
  - Performance optimization guidelines

### 5. Cache Configuration System
- **File**: `/workspaces/aspire-blobstorage/src/blob-storage-management/lib/cache.ts`
- **Content**: Centralized caching system for Azure Storage operations
- **Features**:
  - Cache duration constants for different data types
  - Tag-based cache invalidation system
  - Type-safe cache wrapper functions
  - Debug and monitoring utilities
  - Cache warming strategies

## Architecture Highlights

### Zero API Routes Design
- Direct Azure SDK integration in Server Components
- Server Actions handle all mutations with automatic cache revalidation
- Environment variable security (connection strings never reach client)
- Optimal performance with server-side data fetching

### RSC + Client Component Integration
- Server Components for data fetching and static rendering
- Client Components for interactivity and state management
- Clear composition patterns for embedding client components in RSCs
- Progressive enhancement with form submissions

### Caching Strategy
- Multi-level caching with appropriate TTLs (30s for blobs, 60s for containers, 5min for metrics)
- Tag-based invalidation for precise cache updates
- Next.js built-in caching integration
- Streaming support with React Suspense

### Error Handling & Security
- Custom `AzureStorageError` class with structured error information
- Graceful degradation with error boundaries
- Server-side credential management
- Input validation and sanitization

## Dependencies Added
- **@azure/storage-blob**: Azure Blob Storage SDK for Node.js integration
- All dependencies properly configured in package.json

## Next Steps for Implementation
The architecture is ready for implementation. The next phases should:

1. **Server Component Implementation**: Create the RSC components defined in specifications
2. **Client Component Implementation**: Build interactive UI components
3. **Integration Testing**: Implement the comprehensive test strategy
4. **UI/UX Implementation**: Apply the shadcn/ui design system
